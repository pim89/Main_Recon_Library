PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
	Setup a modular reconstruction framework that allows for easy prototyping and has all the available resources.

Data format:
	Default dataformat is the 12D one employed by reconframe.
	Image space: [X,Y,Z,COIL,DYN,PH,ECH,MIX,LOC,EX1,EX2,AVE]
	K-space: [KX,KY,KZ,COIL,DYN,PH,ECH,MIX,LOC,EX1,EX2,AVE]
	K-space coords: [3 KX,KY,KZ,DYN,PH,ECH,MIX,LOC,EX1,EX2,AVE]


Tested and supported features:
	Read lab/raw data from reconframe
	Read par/rec data from reconframe
	Extract PPE parameters from reconframe 
	Radial trajectory and density functions 
	Radial phase corrections zero method
    	Openadapt and espirit matlab implementations 
    	Option to load k-space data from directory if it was saved
	Iterative density estimation code works for 3D
	Respiratory motion estimation from multi-channel data (coil clustering)
	Respiratory phases binning and transformation of matrices
